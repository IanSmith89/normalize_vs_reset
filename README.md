# Normalize vs. Reset

To see the changes made from normalizing or resetting your CSS, uncomment the links to each stylesheet in index.html individually.

### normalize.css
Notice that normalize.css presents your code with some useful default styling, mainly converting most of the text to a sans serif but keeping most of the default padding/margin etc.

### Meyer Reset
The Meyer reset on the other hand completely resets all elements so that there is no visual difference in styling between an `<h1>` and `<p>` and `<strong>` etc.
